## Tokyo Night GTK Theme

![screenshot](./TokyoNight-Colloid.png?raw-true)

Started as a simple 'tweak' for [Colloid GTK Theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Colloid-gtk-theme) by [vinceliuice](https://github.com/vinceliuice).

However I had to dig deeper into SCSS to implement some of the color choices that I wanted. Right now it's not backwards 'tweak' compatible.

Since I'm using [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland), I have no idea how titlebar will look on different WMs. Also mostly tested with GTK3 apps. Overall this project was intended for my personal use. Use at your own risk :)

For now it only supports dark color scheme. To ease installation `tn_install.sh` is provided in the root folder.

**WARNING:** Since only dark scheme is provided, installing this might break light / dark mode switching.
