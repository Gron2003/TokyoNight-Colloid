## Tokyo Night tweak

This is a simple tweak for the [Colloid GTK Theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Colloid-gtk-theme) by [vinceliuice](https://github.com/vinceliuice).

For now it only supports dark color scheme. To ease installation `tn_install.sh` is provided in the root folder.

**WARNING** Since only dark scheme is provided, installing this might break light / dark mode switching.
